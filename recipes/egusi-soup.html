    <p>So diverse that different recipes exist across different Nigerian ethnic groups</p>
    <p>The Yorubas make efo elegusi while the Igbos make ofe egusi, all with similar ingredients but with slightly different approaches.</p>
    <p>It's a delicious and hearty soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while.</p>
